# Cows and Bulls
I created this project/game as an exercise to learn software design. There will be no branches and ðŸ’© code may sometimes be pushed, consider yourself warned.

The objective of this game to guess a 4 digit (0-9) **secret** code. Feedback for each guess will be given in the form of COWS and BULLS.
- A cow means that a correct number was guessed in the WRONG position.
- A bull means that a correct number was guessed in the CORRECT position.

Example: A secret code of 1234, the guess 1499 would result in 1 BULL (**1**234) and 1 COW (123**4**). 

## Assumptions
These are the assumptions I've made so far:
- The secret is set at the beginning of each game.
- The game will run until the player correctly guesses the secret (4 bulls) or chooses to end the game. 
- A **correct** number means that the digit is used in the secret.

## TBC...
